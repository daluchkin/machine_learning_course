# Association Rule Learning

These are my personal learning notes and experiments conducted while going through the course [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy. This section covers fundamental algorithms used to uncover relationships between items in large datasets, commonly applied in market basket analysis and recommendation systems.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- **Apriori** [>>](./01_Apriori)  
  A classic algorithm for association rule mining that finds frequent itemsets using the anti-monotonic property. It is widely used for discovering strong associations in transactional datasets.

- **Aclat** [>>](./02_Aclat)  
  Aclat leverages a vertical data format to speed up frequent itemset mining by using intersection-based counting rather than horizontal scanning.
