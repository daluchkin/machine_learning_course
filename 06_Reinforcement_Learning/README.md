# Reinforcement Learning 

These are my personal learning notes and experiments conducted while going through the course [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy. This section covers fundamental **Reinforcement Learning** algorithms used for **decision-making in uncertain environments**, commonly applied in **multi-armed bandit problems, online advertising, recommendation systems, and game AI**. Reinforcement Learning is a powerful branch of Machine Learning. It is used to solve interacting problems where the data observed up to time $t$ is considered to decide which action to take at time $t + 1$. It is also used for Artificial Intelligence when training machines to perform tasks such as walking. Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward, undesired with punishment. Machines learn through trial and error. 

## Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** [>>](./01_Upper_Confidence_Bound_UCB)  
  UCB is a deterministic algorithm that balances **exploration and exploitation** by using confidence intervals to prioritize actions that have high potential rewards but have not been fully explored. It is widely used in **online learning, A/B testing, and resource allocation problems**.  

- **Thompson Sampling** [>>](./02_Thompson_Sampling)  
  Thompson Sampling is a **Bayesian approach** to reinforcement learning that samples from a **posterior distribution** to determine the best action. It naturally handles **uncertainty** and adapts efficiently to changing environments, making it effective for **online advertising, recommendation systems, and medical trials**.
