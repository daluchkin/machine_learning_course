# Thompson Sampling

This section of the repository is dedicated to the **Thompson Sampling** algorithm and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).  

## **Section Description**  

This topic presents the practical application of the **Thompson Sampling algorithm**, structured step-by-step through the process of solving **multi-armed bandit problems**. Thompson Sampling is a **Bayesian reinforcement learning** technique used to balance **exploration and exploitation** by maintaining a probabilistic belief about the expected rewards of different actions. It is widely applied in **online advertising, recommendation systems, clinical trials, and adaptive A/B testing**.
