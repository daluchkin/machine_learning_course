# Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)

This section of the repository is dedicated to the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**  Algorithm and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).  

## **Section Description**  

This topic presents the practical application of the **UCB algorithm**, structured step-by-step through the process of solving **multi-armed bandit problems**. UCB is a **reinforcement learning** technique used to balance **exploration and exploitation** when making decisions under uncertainty. It is widely applied in **online advertising, recommendation systems, A/B testing, and dynamic pricing strategies**.
