# Clustering

These are my personal learning notes and experiments conducted while going through the course [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy. Each section covers a different classification algorithm, diving into the theory, implementation, and practical applications, helping you understand how to apply them effectively.

## Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering** [>>](./01_K_Means_Clustering)  
  A popular unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions data into `k` clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It iteratively assigns points to the nearest cluster center and updates the centers until convergence.

- **Hierarchical Clustering** [>>](./02_Hierarchical_Clustering)  
  A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters either through agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches. It uses a dendrogram to visualize the cluster merging or splitting process and helps identify the optimal number of clusters.
