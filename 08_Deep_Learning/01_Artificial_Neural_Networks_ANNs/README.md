# Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This section of the repository is dedicated to the **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** for a business problem and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).  

## **Section Description**  

This topic presents the practical application of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**, structured step-by-step to solve real-world business challenges. **ANNs** are deep learning models inspired by the human brain, capable of recognizing patterns and making complex predictions. They are widely used in customer behavior analysis, fraud detection, sales forecasting, and personalized recommendations. By leveraging multiple layers of neurons, **ANNs** learn from historical data to optimize decision-making and improve business outcomes.
