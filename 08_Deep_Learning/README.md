# Deep Learning

These are my personal learning notes and experiments conducted while going through the course [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy. This section covers fundamental **Deep Learning** techniques used for solving complex tasks in various domains, including **computer vision, time series analysis, feature extraction, and recommendation systems**.

## Deep Learning Models

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** [>>](./01_Artificial_Neural_Networks_ANNs) 
  ANNs are the foundation of Deep Learning, capable of solving regression and classification problems by mimicking the way biological neurons process information.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** [>>](./02_Convolutional_Neural_Networks_CNNs) 
  CNNs specialize in processing visual data, enabling tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
