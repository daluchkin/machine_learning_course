# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This section of the repository is dedicated to the **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for a computer vision task and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).  

## **Section Description**  

This topic presents the practical application of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, structured step-by-step to solve real-world computer vision challenges. **CNNs** are deep learning models designed to process and analyze visual data, excelling at recognizing patterns and extracting meaningful features from images. They are widely used in image classification, object detection, facial recognition, and medical imaging. By leveraging convolutional layers, **CNNs** automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features, enabling highly accurate and efficient visual analysis.
