# Logistic Regression

This section of the repository is dedicated to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning).

## Section Description

This section focuses on finding the best kernel for the Support Vector Machine (SVM). It compares different kernels, such as radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial, using grid search and cross-validation. The goal is to choose the kernel that gives the best performance for the dataset by tuning key parameters like cost and gamma.
