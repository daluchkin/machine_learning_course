# Classification

These are my personal learning notes and experiments conducted while going through the course [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy. Each section covers a different classification algorithm, diving into the theory, implementation, and practical applications, helping you understand how to apply them effectively.

## Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

- **Logistic Regression** [>>](./01_Logistic_Regression)  
  A fundamental algorithm used for binary classification problems. It models the probability of a target variable belonging to a class based on input features using the logistic function.

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** [>>](./02_K-Nearest_Heighbors_KNN)  
  A simple, non-parametric algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority vote of their nearest neighbors in the feature space.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** [>>](./03_Support_Vector_Machine_SVM)  
  A powerful algorithm for linear and non-linear classification that finds the optimal hyperplane separating classes with the maximum margin.

- **Kernel SVM** [>>](./04_Kernel_SVM)  
  An extension of SVM that uses kernel functions to handle non-linear decision boundaries by mapping data into higher-dimensional spaces.

- **Naive Bayes** [>>](./05_Naive_Bayes)  
  A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features. It's efficient and works well for text classification tasks like spam detection.

- **Decision Tree Classification** [>>](./06_Decision_Tree_Classification)  
  A tree-based model that splits data based on feature values to classify outcomes. It is intuitive and interpretable for many practical applications.

- **Random Forest Classification** [>>](./07_Random_Forest_Classification)  
  An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting, leveraging the power of randomness.

- **Classification Model Selection** [>>](./08_Classification_Model_Selection)  
  Guidance on how to evaluate and select the best classification model for your problem using techniques such as cross-validation, ROC-AUC, and F1-score.
