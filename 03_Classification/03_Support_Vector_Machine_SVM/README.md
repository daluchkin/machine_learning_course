# Logistic Regression

This section of the repository is dedicated to the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning).

## Section Description

This section focuses on Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised learning algorithm for classification (e.g., Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam) and regression tasks. SVM works by constructing optimal hyperplanes to separate data and can handle non-linear relationships using kernel functions. Common applications include recommendation systems, pattern recognition, image classification, and customer segmentation.
