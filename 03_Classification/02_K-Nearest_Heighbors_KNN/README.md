# K-Nearest Neighbors Classification

This section of the repository is dedicated to the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R + ChatGPT Prize [2024]** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning).

## Section Description

This section focuses on the machine learning technique known as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This method is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification (e.g., binary outcomes like Yes/No, 0/1, Spam/Not Spam) and regression tasks. For classification, it predicts the outcome based on the majority class of the  $k$ nearest neighbors. KNN is widely applied in recommendation systems, pattern recognition, image classification, and customer segmentation.
