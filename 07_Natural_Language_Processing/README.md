# Natural Language Processing 

These are my personal learning notes and experiments conducted while going through the course [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy. This section covers fundamental **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques used for **analyzing and understanding human language**, commonly applied in **chatbots, sentiment analysis, machine translation, text summarization, and search engines**. NLP is a powerful branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to process and generate human language. It is used to transform unstructured text into meaningful data representations for various applications. NLP techniques range from rule-based models to deep learning approaches. By leveraging vast linguistic datasets, machines can extract insights, recognize patterns, and generate responses, making NLP essential for modern AI-driven communication and automation.


## NLP models

- **Bag of Words (BoW)** [>>](./01_Bag_of_Words_BoW)  
  Bag of Words (BoW) is a simple text representation in NLP that ignores grammar and word order, focusing only on word occurrences. It creates a vocabulary of unique words and represents each text as a word frequency count, making it useful for text analysis and machine learning.
