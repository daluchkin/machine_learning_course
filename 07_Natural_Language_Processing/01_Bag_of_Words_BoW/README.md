# Bag of Words (BoW)

This section of the repository is dedicated to the **Bag of Words (BoW)**  model and is part of the course **Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R** hosted on Udemy. You can find more information about the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/).  

## **Section Description**  

This topic presents the practical application of the **Bag of Words (BoW) model**, structured step-by-step through the process of converting text into numerical representations. BoW is a **natural language processing (NLP)** technique that transforms text data into a word frequency-based format while ignoring grammar and word order. It is widely used in **text classification, sentiment analysis, spam detection, and information retrieval**.
