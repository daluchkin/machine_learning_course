# Dimensionality Reduction

These are my personal learning notes and experiments from the course [Machine Learning A-Z: AI, Python & R](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) on Udemy. **Dimensionality Reduction** techniques help improve machine learning models by reducing the number of independent variables while preserving important information. This enhances model efficiency, prevents overfitting, and allows better visualization.

## Types of Dimensionality Reduction

- **Feature Selection**  
  This method selects the most important features while discarding the least relevant ones. Common techniques include:
  - Backward Elimination
  - Forward Selection
  - Bidirectional Elimination
  - Score Comparison  

- **Feature Extraction**  
  This method transforms existing features into a new set of uncorrelated features while retaining as much information as possible.

## Feature Extraction Techniques 

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** [>>](./01_Principal_Component_Analysis_PCA)  
  PCA reduces the dataset's dimensionality by finding new axes (principal components) that capture the most variance in the data.

- **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** [>>](./02_Linear_Discriminant_Analysis_LDA)  
  LDA is a supervised method that reduces dimensionality while maximizing class separability.

- **Kernel PCA** [>>](./03_Kernel_Principal_Component_Analysis)  
  Kernel PCA extends PCA by applying kernel functions, allowing for nonlinear transformations that better capture complex patterns in the data.
